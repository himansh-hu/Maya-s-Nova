Please provide a comprehensive overview of my project hosted on Replit, titled "Ecommerce_3d" or similar, to help me understand and run it locally. I need all possible details, including:

1. **Project Structure**: A complete directory tree of all folders and files, including `client/`, `server/`, `attached_assets/`, `shared/`, and any other directories. List key files like `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and any backend entry points (e.g., `server/index.ts`).

2. **Dependencies**: The full contents of all `package.json` files (root and any subdirectories like `client/` or `server/`). Include all dependencies, devDependencies, and scripts.

3. **Configuration Files**: The contents of configuration files, including:
   - `.replit` (for run commands and environment settings).
   - `vite.config.ts` (Vite configuration for the frontend).
   - `drizzle.config.ts` (if a backend database is used).
   - `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and any other relevant config files.
   - Any `.env` or `.env.example` files with environment variable requirements.

4. **Scripts and Run Instructions**: Detailed instructions for running the project, including:
   - Commands to start the frontend (React Vite app in `client/`).
   - Commands to start the backend (if it exists, e.g., in `server/`).
   - Any database setup or migration steps (e.g., for Drizzle ORM).
   - How Replit’s environment (e.g., secrets, ports) affects local setup.

5. **Backend Status**: Clarify if a backend exists in `server/`. If so, provide:
   - The contents of `server/index.ts` or other entry points.
   - Database setup details (e.g., PostgreSQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`, migrations with `drizzle-kit`).
   - API endpoints or mock data usage.

6. **Frontend Details**: Information about the React frontend in `client/`:
   - How `client/src/App.tsx` and `client/src/pages/` are structured.
   - How assets in `attached_assets/` are used (e.g., 3D models for `three.js`).
   - Whether mock data is used (e.g., in `client/src/data.js`) or if API calls expect a backend.

7. **Replit-Specific Setup**: Any Replit-specific configurations, such as:
   - Environment variables set in Replit’s Secrets tab.
   - Custom run buttons or deployment settings.
   - How Replit handles the frontend (`client/`) and backend (`server/`) interaction.

8. **Troubleshooting Tips**: Common issues when running the project locally (e.g., Windows-specific command issues, missing dependencies, port conflicts).

9. **Additional Notes**: Any other details (e.g., Replit plugins, AI Agent usage, or specific Replit features) that would help me run the frontend locally to showcase the UI and check for a functional backend.
